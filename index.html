                    <p class="flex-wrap">Hey, I am Parker, a dungeon master, home chef, and programmer. Attempting to write an “about me,” (I hate writing about myself). After working food service and losing myself in becoming a perfect corporate minion, I had to do something to keep my sanity. </p>
                    <p class="flex-wrap">So I invented worlds in my few hours to myself, wanting to make a video game or book. I couldn’t program, nor did I have the motivation to write a story by myself. Inevitably, tabletop gaming was the medium I found my passion in. A collaborative storytelling that my friends and family enjoyed interacting with, while I could act as the rules and narrator to their actions.</p>
                    <p class="flex-wrap">I have incorporated many of the random skills I have developed over the years (heavy metal vocals being the most obtuse of these) into crafting videogame like worlds to laugh at and enjoy. I have taught many people how to play Dungeons and Dragons, and more obscurely Call of Cthulhu. Rolling dice has become a part of me, and I get to flex a creative muscle that helps me with solving my problems in real life. I get to escape for a while.</p>
                    <p class="flex-wrap">Other than tabletop gaming, I enjoy cooking, critiquing music, analyzing movies, and now coding!</p>
                    <p class="flex-wrap">I also have a lovely wife who supports me in my hobbies and passions, and I absolutely adore her with all my heart. Soon enough I will have a beautiful baby girl to cherish. </p>
